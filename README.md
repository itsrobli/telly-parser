# telly-parser

## Features _intended_ (emphasis ðŸ™ƒ)

- [ ] Parse filenames like those listed in [test_data](tests%2Ftest_data) and give back a custom data structure.

- [ ] Given the structure of the filename cannot be 100% guaranteed, optionally, find a canonical record from [tvdb](https://thetvdb.com) or [tmdb](https://www.themoviedb.org) based on what can be parsed.
